Hi, I have mentioned all the libraries/packages which I have used on this project in requirements.txt file.

Once you installed all the packages, you can start the uvicorn server and can see the APIs on Swagger

The database has 4 fields - ID, city, latitude and longitude

I have used pydantic for data validation and sqlalchemy as object-relational mapper

I have used a distance matrix API for calculationg distance between 
two sets of latitude and longitude coordinates to get all addresses falling within the specified range.
